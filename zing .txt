Practical 4
Navigating the vSphere Clients. 

The VMware vSphere Client is a web-based application that connects to the vCenter Server so IT administrators can manage installations and handle inventory objects in a vSphere deployment. vSphere Client is a part of VMware’s comprehensive product line.
As an application, VMware vSphere Client enables the management of a vSphere installation so IT administrators can access key functions of vSphere without needing access to a vSphere server directly. The vSphere Client presents a graphical user interface (GUI) with an object navigator, the main workspace, as well as the tasks and alarms panel. Through this GUI, vSphere administrators can manage and supervise the objects listed in a virtualized data centre.

1.VSPHERE WEB CLIENT
REQUIREMENTS:
0-1 domain controller for authentication
Storage server to provide storage

Step 1: Install the adobe flash which is prerequisites for this client to work.

Step 2: Sign on to the vmware single using the  username and password
Click on login (using nic account to login).

Step 3: On the Home Screen Check on
Monitor to monitor issues,System logs and sessions.
Configure to configure settings
Permissions –defined permissions for each task
VMS- Different Virtual machines

Step 4: Click on NMBD datacentre check for all the datastorage devices available.

Step 5: Click on your existing virtual machine now click on add new virtual machine power on the virtual machine and check on the status bar for results.
Step 6: NOW SWITCHING TO THE NEW VSPHERE CLIENT
It is named as vSphere client HTML
It is created by VMWare itself and do not depend on any third-party tools to be installed for working with it.

Step 7:Now open the link for vSphere client html on the new tab
Login using your username and password
On this interface we have monitor to monitor issues, sessions, logs etc.

Step 8:Click on the existing virtual machine select maintenance mode and click on exit maintenance mode.

Step 9:Click on the ISCSI-VMFS-Datastore1 and select browse files
Check for all the files.

Practical 5:
Creating Folders in vCenter Server Appliance

Step 1:Go to vSphere Web Client

Step 2:Shutdown the guest OS (NLB-PC-01)

Step 3:To create a folder, right click on NLBDatacenter -> New Folder -> New Host and Cluster Folder.

Step 4:Enter folder name as “Main Office” -> ok

Step 5:Now empty “Main Office” folder will be created on the left panel.

Step 6:Drag and drop “nlb-esxi-01.nlblab.com” host in the “Main Office” folder.

Step 7:Create another folder, right click on NLBDatacenter -> New Folder -> New Host and Cluster Folder.

Step 8:Enter folder name as “Back Office” -> ok

Step 9:Drag and drop the second “nlb-esxi-02.nlblab.com” host in the “Back Office” folder.

Step 10:Next go to VM’s and Template’s folder, click on “summary”.

Step 11:On the left panel, right click on NLBDatacenter -> New Folder -> New VM and Template Folder.

Step 12:Enter folder name as “Generalized Template” -> ok

Step 13:We can store different templates in this folder.

Step 14:Right click on NLBDatacenter -> New Folder -> New VM and Template Folder.

Step 15:Enter folder name as “Main Office” -> ok

Step 16:Move vm “NLB-PC-01” in main office folder.

Step 17:If you click on the main office folder, it will give you the summary of what’s inside that folder.

Using Standard Switches

Step 1: Power on VMware > Power on ESXi > copy https://www.lantmateriet.se/en/geodata/gps-geodesi-och-swepos/gps-and-	satellite-positioning/methods-for-gnss-measurement/absolute-and-relative-positioning/#anchor-0the IP address which 	show on screen

Step 2: Open vSphere Client then enter IP address that you copy from ESXi
            Enter username & password then click on Login

Step 3: Click on ESXi servers IP
	On the Right Hand side we will find configuration tab under configuration tab select Networking > Click on add 	Networking > Next
 
Step 4: Create a two network BMS, IT
	On the network label give your network name > click next > Ok
 
 
	Here are  we create IT & BMS Switches
 
Step 5: Now assign system to particular Machine for that first we have to Create a Virtual Machine > Click on IP address 	which present on Right hand side> New Virtual Machine > Click Next > Give Name to machine > create
 
Step 6: Right hand side click on any one virtual Machine> edit Setting > Network Adapter > from drop down select any on 	network. 
 
	Click on next > Next
   

Step 7: Finish 
 
Repeat same steps for Other virtual Machine

Practical 7                                                                                         
Accessing ISCSI Storage.

iSCSI stands for "Internet Small Computer System Interface." It's a protocol used for linking data storage facilities over a network, typically Ethernet. iSCSI enables the transmission of SCSI commands over IP networks
Initiator: The initiator is the client device that initiates the request for data from the storage device. It could be a server, desktop, or any other computing device that requires access to the storage.
Target: The target is the storage device that holds the data being accessed. It could be a disk array, a tape library, or even a single hard drive. The target responds to the requests made by the initiator.

Step 1: Open vSphere Client
 
Step 2:  Click configuration ->  Storage Adaptor add ISCSI  Network ConfigurationAddDynamic DiscoveryAdd (Enter VM’s Name)
 
Step 3: Click On Add > OK > OK

Step 4:  Right Click on ISCSI Storage adapter name > Property 
 
Step 5: Network Configuration > Add > OK
 
Step 6:  Click on Dynamic Discovery > Add > for ISCSI Server choose your Virtual Machine Name > OK 
 
Here We add successfully ISCSI Target
 
Step 7: For Checking Advance Setting > Click on Target Name > The Click on Advance

Practical: CISCO 
Deploying and Configuring a Virtual Machine

Step 1: open the Cisco packet tracer

Step 2: Take two pcs (clients) and one switch

Step 3: Switch is use to create LAN and it’s use to interconnect pcs on LAN

Step 4: Configure PC0 with Ip 192.168.1.101 and PC1 with 192.168.1.100 and connect both the PCs with switch

Step 5: Now both the PCs are on the same LAN and they talk to each other

Step 6:Go on PC0 and open command prompt Ping the other PCs ip on this PC

Step 7: Click on switch then open CLI and type following command
 
Step 8: Click on switch then open CLI and type following commands 

Step 9: This will show all VLANs here VLAN1 is default VLAN when you cannot delete it 

Step 10 :Now we will create additional VLANs By following commands 
Here we we will create VLAN50 with name TYITstudent
Now this VLAN is active 

Step 11: Now we will configure this VLAN
In interface configuration we will assign switch port mode axis to this VLAN.
Now we VLAN 50 has port10 assign to it.
